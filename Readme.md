# Full Portfolio – BengalCatBalu

Welcome to my extended portfolio.

Here you’ll find results from past audits, selected bugs I’ve found, and structured notes that reflect how I approach protocol security.

## 👤 About Me

I started out in math — the kind that makes you think in graphs, invariants, and proofs.  
In school, I succesfully competed in math olympiads and spent a lot of time exploring discrete structures and formal logic. That mindset stuck with me.

Later I studied software engineering, which gave me the tools to build. But what really drew me in was the way complex systems fail — subtly, structurally, and sometimes beautifully.

Since September 2024, I've been working independently as a Web3 security researcher.  
I focus on smart contract architecture, DeFi mechanisms, Layer 2 systems, and the weird edge cases where code, economics, and design collide.

## ⭐️ Web3 Security Results

I’ve worked across various protocol types — from AMMs and vaults to bridges, governance logic, and L2 systems.

My focus is on edge cases, implicit assumptions, and architectural flaws.  
Not just finding bugs, but understanding *why* they happen — and how to design them out.
